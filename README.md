Tinder++
========

It's a node-webkit app.

You'll need to run `npm install` in both the main directory, and inside of desktop-app before starting.

To compile your changes and test:

First, download node-webkit: https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit

```
cd desktop-app
zip -r tinder.nw *
/path/to/your/node-webkit tinder.nw
```

Note: if you don't have Wine installed and want to run the build script (`node build.js`), just delete the `winIco` field from build.js
